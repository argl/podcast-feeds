    <description>In this episode, Marcus Couch and I are joined by Andrew Bergeron, founder of Visual Rhythm. Bergeron explains the effort and investment it takes to create memorable logos. He also shares tips on how to avoid designing forgettable logos. We also learn the history of the Nike Swoosh logo created by Carolyn Davidson in 1971.

Stories Discussed:

WordPress 4.4 RC1 Released
Nearly Half of the WordPress Plugins in the Directory Are Not Updated After Two Years
Freemius Insights Enables Plugin Developers to Make Data-Driven Decisions
Joost de Valk on the Lessons Learned After Releasing WordPress SEO 3.0

Plugins Picked By Marcus:

Featured Image Reminder by Aaron Hockley from Vancouver, WA, displays a reminder if you press the Publish button and forget to assign a featured image to the post.

Cart links for WooCommerce by Soft79 allows store managers to create urls that redirect a customer to a pre-populated cart. This is useful for email campaigns and call to action buttons.

WaveSurfer-WP by Raymond Radet from France, replaces the default WordPress audio player with one that displays audio waveforms. It displays a mix of different audio channels for podcasts, radio, e-learning, and music or all channels simultaneously for audio tutorials, sound-packs, product demos, etc. which is its main purpose.

    <description>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, Marcus Couch and I are joined by Chris Lema to discuss WordPress in the enterprise, the on boarding experience, and Calypso. Lema shares his experience beta testing a Windows version of Automattic&#039;s new desktop application. We discuss how WordPress is going to grow its market share from 25% to 50% and how important Jetpack is to reaching that goal. Near the end of the interview, Lema shares what he&#039;s most thankful for as it relates to WordPress.

Stories Discussed:

Automattic Unveils Open Source WordPress.com Desktop Application for the Mac

Plugins Picked By Marcus:

WP TAO by Michal Jaworski and Damian Gora from Poland, is a free powerful WordPress plugin for tracking website visitors. It allows you to identify your users and keep track of their activities in an easy to read digital dashboard and log format.

Cool Timeline is Narinder Singh&#039;s first plugin in the repository. It creates responsive, vertical story lines in chronological order based on the year and date of your posts.

The Force created by Rohit Motwani from India, is a Hello Dolly clone that when activated, replaces music lyrics with random quotes from Star Wars characters.

What I&#039;m Thankful For:

This has been a rough year for me. I’m struggling with my health and maintaining a schedule as a distributed worker. A dear WordPress friend of mine (Kim Parsell) passed away at the beginning of the year. My grandma was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and I’ve been dealing with wild swings between feeling positive and downright depressed.

The thing I’m most thankful for this year as it relates to WordPress are the people who make up the community. Some are personal friends, others live on the other side of the world. Their consistent reinforcement of positive vibes has helped me get through some turbulent times in my life this year. To everyone who has and continues to give me encouragement, advice, and positive reinforcement, thank you.

What Marcus is Thankful For:

This year was one of the hardest years for me in terms of professional struggles and hardships. I lost relatives and friends, a job, and had to start from square one. I had a lot of support from within the WordPress community coming really close to working with a few people directly. In the end, it was my WordPress skills that landed me a new gig, which I now call The Dream Gig.

I’m thankful for the opportunities to meet people from within the WordPress community in real life. From Chris Lema and Cory Miller to Jeff Chandler and beyond. Every time I meet someone, they not only share their successes, but their struggles. It’s good to know that I’m not the only one and be able to use their strength and perseverance to fuel my drive and passion for WordPress.

I’m thankful for the opportunity to share what I know to thousands of people around the world. I feel the best sense of accomplishment when I receive an email from someone that&#039;s stuck on a particular problem and discovers a solution after they hear me talk about a plugin or technique on a podcast. It’s a great outlet for me personally that I hope to continue for many more years to come. Thanks to all who are listening and to those who are listening for the first time.

    <description>In this episode, Marcus Couch and I discuss the last two weeks of WordPress news. We go in-depth on what&#039;s coming in WordPress 4.4 and I share a story of how upgrading WP Tavern to WordPress 4.4 beta 4 generated a white screen of death.

We cover what&#039;s new in BuddyPress 2.4 and celebrate the milestone that WordPress is used on 25% of the top 10 million sites ranked by Alexa. Last but not least, we discuss how WordPress may reach 50% and what it means for the web.

Stories Discussed:

WordPress 4.4 Beta 4 Released
WP Remote Is Up for Sale
Pro Plugin Directory Is Seeking a New Owner
BuddyPress 2.4.0 – “Pietro”
More Than 250 Tickets Still Available for WordCamp US
A Quarter of the Top 10 Million Sites Ranked by Alexa Use WordPress

Plugins Picked By Marcus:

Ad Blocking Advisor adds a simple and elegant notification bar to your site that only displays to visitors who are using ad blocking software. The purpose of the notification is to ask (or advise) visitors to whitelist your site.

MatchHeight adds the MatchHeight jQuery plugin to make the height of all selected elements exactly equal.

WP Term Images by John James Jacoby allows users to assign images to any visible category, tag, or taxonomy term using the media library, providing a customized look for taxonomies.

    <description>In this episode, Marcus Couch and I are joined by Kyle Maurer, Co-founder of Real Big Marketing. Maurer grew up in rural Michigan working on farms without much knowledge of the IT industry. He registered an account on meetup.com after discovering a WordPress meetup in his local area.

During the meetup, Maurer discovered how powerful WordPress is. The knowledge he gained motivated him to dive deep into WordPress and eventually start his own development agency.

We discuss his most recent project, WordCrash, which allows people in the WordPress community to offer travelers a place to stay for free. We also discuss his involvement with WordPress.TV where Maurer volunteers to moderate videos, contribute code to the site, and coordinate projects. Last but not least, we discuss WP Roundtable, a weekly WordPress podcast hosted by Maurer and a panel of WordPress personalities.

Stories Discussed:

WordPress 4.4 Beta 2 Released

Plugins Picked By Marcus:

Media DeDuper saves disk space and brings some order to the chaos of your media library by removing and preventing duplicate files.

Feature Request is an advanced feature request and suggestion submitter with a built-in voting system for WordPress.

Minimum Dimensions For Image Field allows the user to set size constraints for the Featured Image field.

    <description>In this time travel inspired episode of WordPress Weekly, Marcus Couch and I catch you up on the news of the week. I start the show by sharing my experience attending the first WordCamp Hampton Roads in Virginia Beach, VA. While in Virginia Beach, I visited and worked from the Rocketgenius office and observed how the team behind Gravity Forms works on a daily basis. In the show, I explain why I think the company&#039;s setup is the best of both worlds for distributed workers.

We discuss what the future of WordPress may be like 10 years from now and whether or not it&#039;s time for the XML-RPC protocol to be removed from WordPress. We end the show with the plugin picks of the week.

Stories Discussed:

Anyssa Ferreira Awarded the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship
WP_Title is deprecated in WordPress 4.4
What Will WordPress Be Like In Next 10 Years? Here’s an awesome comment on the article.
It’s Time for XML-RPC in WordPress to Hit the Road

Plugins Picked By Marcus:

WooCommerce Price Per Word allows customers to upload a document to the product page. The word-count of the document is used to calculate the price based on the price-per-word entered for the product.

Shortcode Tester is a post editor tool for WordPress developers that displays the HTML generated by WordPress shortcodes in a popup window. You can quickly view the generated HTML without having to view the entire post.

Beehive cells arranges the content on your front page into a series of hexagonal cells similar to a beehive.

    <itunes:summary>In this time travel inspired episode of WordPress Weekly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marcuscouch.com/&quot;&gt;Marcus Couch&lt;/a&gt; and I catch you up on the news of the week. I start the show by sharing my experience attending the first WordCamp Hampton Roads in Virginia Beach, VA. While in Virginia Beach, I visited and worked from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rocketgenius.com/&quot;&gt;Rocketgenius&lt;/a&gt; office and observed how the team behind Gravity Forms works on a daily basis. In the show, I explain why I think the company&#039;s setup is the best of both worlds for distributed workers.

We discuss what the future of WordPress may be like 10 years from now and whether or not it&#039;s time for the XML-RPC protocol to be removed from WordPress. We end the show with the plugin picks of the week.

    <description>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, I&#039;m joined by Miriam Schwab, founder and CEO of Illuminea, a web development company based in Israel. She’s also on the Steering Board of Digital Eve Israel, one of the leading communities for professional women in Israel to help empower women economically.

Schwab explains her WordPress origin story, what it&#039;s like to live in Israel, and how active the WordPress community is in her area. She shares her thoughts on the future of WordPress and warns that if it doesn&#039;t improve the user experience, it will drive users away to competing platforms. At the end of the interview, she tells us her favorite plugins that she installs on most of her client sites.
